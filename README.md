julia_netcdf
============

NetCDF support for the julia programming language, there is a high-level and a medium-level interface for writing and reading netcdf files. 

# Igh-level functions

The high-level API is quite similar to the Matlab NetCDF interface, so reading files will look like:

    x = ncread ("myfile.nc", "Radiation")
    
which will read the variable called "Radiation" from the file "myfile.nc". General information can be gained by using 

    ncinfo ( filename )
    
which gives an overview of the dimensions, variables and attributes stored in the file. Creating variables and files is done by using the nccreate command:

    filename   = "myfile.nc"
    varname    = "precipitation.nc"
    attributes = {"units"    => "mm/d",
    			  "data_min" => 0.0,
    			  "data_max" => 87.0}
    
    nccreate ( "myfile.nc" , "" , attributes , dimensions â€¦ )
    
This will create the variable called varname in the file
